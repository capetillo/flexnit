## F L E X N I T

Flexnit is an application for those of use who are tired of browsing for 20 minutes through Netflix and Hulu looking for a show until we realize that the show is on HBO Go and we're not going to pay \$45 to use it once a month. This app uses the Utelly API, which searches for the platform in which a show or movie is provided. The user can sign up, log in, and log out. The user can save and remove movies/shows to their watchlist as well as access their watchlist.
